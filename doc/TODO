List of nice things to have:

- multi-vault support.
- branch/tag/HEAD detection: if a checkout is needed and the build.sync file says to pull
                             to a branch. it should check if it is a branch and pull to the
                             branch and not to the related commit to avoid detached HEAD if
                             possible. same with HEAD.
