Bsync - Build Synchronizer Tool -
Planning Document
Author: Erick Cafferata

Overview

Bsync is a tool for building applications that use external projects, like libraries,
which are versioned in a Git repository. What the tool does is retrieve all the required
versions of each dependency needed by the application (parent project) and repeats it
recursively until it gets the right components for making the specific build version.

User Workflow:

The expected user, in theory, will have several projects in his work area. The projects in
question will be: front-end/application projects which will mostly require other projects
like OSes, libraries or ports to work, and back-end/libraries projects which will mostly be
used by the former type.
The user will need to develop a certain project for which he will need a number of back-end
projects. Assuming all the related projects exist in the workarea as well. the user can
perform several actions ,like:

1) Begin to work in a new project:
  - To do this, the user will need to decide which versions of each dependency he will
    use for his project. Once decided, he will write his desired configuration inside the
    build.sync file of his new project. Once configured, the user can run the 'bsync check'
    command inside the project repository to testrun the configuration and check if there 
    are any issues. If there are, he can keep modifying the configuration file until it's OK.
  - With everything OK, the user can start develop his project. Although it is not needed,
    it is advisable to make a Git commmit for the modification of build.sync alone.

2) Return to an already existing project:
  - Go to the project repository, and run the 'bsync up [git_commit]' command. If the
    'git_commit' parameter is used, the command will attempt to checkout that commit from
    the parent project. If not, it will use the current HEAD. Then it will perform a check
    internally. If it fails, it will abort, and return every project to its original state.
  - After this, the current repository can be a detached HEAD or not, in either case, it's
    responsability of the user to do anything he sees fit.

3) Upgrade an older project to make it work with a new dependency:
  - To do this, the user has to run a 'git checkout [-b newbranch]' to go to the place in
    project history where he sees fit to place the new upgrade.
  - Now, in the [new] branch of the project repository, if the build.sync file doesnt exist,
    create build.sync and add the required dependencies. If it does exist, add the new
    dependency/version.
  - Run a 'bsync check' to make sure everything works just right. If it does. make a git
    commit(recommended) or keep working.

4) Upgrade an older project to make it work with an updated dependency:
  - To do this, is very similar to the previous one. go to the place in the project history
    where the user sees fit to place the new upgrade.
  - Modify build.sync and substitute the version part of the dependency with the new version.
  - Run a 'bsync check' to make sure everything works just right. If it does. make a git
    commit(recommended) or keep working.

5**)Solve a bug in a older project build which has been superseeded:
  - This depends mainly on a case by case basis. but the use of the tool itself is pretty
    much the same. First, checkout the desired place in the repository history to make the
    fix.
  - Make the fixes needed and commit. As long as the build.sync file already exists, and the
    dependency list doesn't need to be changed, the tool doesnt need to be used at all to
    coexist with the project progress.

TECHNICAL STUFF:

Projects and/or dependencies:

All Projects handled by bsync need to be inside the path designated by the environment
variable BSYNC_PATH.
A project and/or dependency does NOT need to be version controlled. If it is though, it
should be a Git repository. As long as it has a build.sync file the tool will understand how
to work.

Dependencies Configuration File <build.sync>:

Each project working under bsync needs to contain the dependencies file named 'build.sync'.
The 'build.sync' file can be located at the project's root folder or inside the 'src' folder.
In the case the 'build.sync' file is not available in either of those locations, the script
will keep working without error, and it will assume that the project does NOT have any
dependencies, it will INFO it and exit.

Each dependency used by the project should be defined inside the build.sync file.
The entry format is the following one:

-One dependency per line.
-line comments start with '#' character.

example:
ProjectName|Version[:option1:option2..:optionN]//(Options still TBD)

where:
-ProjectName is the name of the project folder in the main vault.
-Version is the Id of the commit hash, it can take the form of:
  A git commit hash.
  A git tag.(recommended)
  A HEAD variable or any other kind of git commit-id.(not recommended)
  *Version can be only one(for now) and it can be left empty. If so, it does not refresh the dependency.

Feature List:
(from basic/main to advanced/crazy)

1) Update All dependencies required by an specific project build. [main functionality]
  [Implementation Details]
  -Middle level script: [bsync-down](bsync downstream)
  -It will handle all function-related option validation first.
  -Do a 2-phase process:
    a) First, [bsync-checkgraph] a checkup phase which will look around for any issues like:
      -Not existent buildtags: A dependency build tag in a build.sync document does not
      exist in that dependency's repository.
      -N-way dependency Ambiguity: N different build.sync files referred to different
      versions of the same dependency.
      -cyclical dependency: A dependency graph which ends at the starting point.
      This script will use a low-level script itself for parsing the build.sync file
      [bsync-parse].
    b) And second, an action phase[bsync-checkout], in which the actual dependency refresh
       will be exectuted. All the different checkout options will be handled by this script.
  -Optimize checkup phase: For doing this, a good idea is to only get the build.sync
   file from required version instead of checking out the whole project and do all the
   relevant checks.
  -Optimize action phase: during checkup phase, taking advantage of the fact that the
  build.sync file is opened. save all the relevant info of the refreshes as a temp file,
  that way during the action phase the refresh process will be straight forward and quick.

2) Modify and update dependencies list securely. [Main functionality]
  [Implementation Details]
  -Middle level script: [bsync-up](bsync upstream)
  -It will handle all function-related option validation first.
  -There are several ways the user would like to modify the dependencies list, such as:
    a)By manual checkout of the dependencies repositories and then wishing that to be
    reflected in the build.sync file.
    b)By adding a particular dependency/version pair to the project dependencies directly by
    command line.
    c)By removing a particular dependency/version pair from the dependencies list directly by
    command line.
   The script will handle all previous case scenarios.
  -In either case, there will be options for handling new dependencies addition. If the option
  is not used, the script will abort and give a warning.
  -To maintain build.sync integrity, before saving changes, the script will run a check
  [bsync-checkgraph] to test if the new build list is a valid one. If not, it will abort and
  give a warning.

-----------

3) Add Secondary Versions to build.sync

4) Add Multi-vault Support
  [Implementation Details]
  -BSYNC_PATH modification: Extend BSYNC_PATH usability by using a $PATH-like format to support
   multiple paths. ie: PATH1:PATH2:PATH3:..PATHN
  -The build.sync file format should NOT change because of this. The tool will search for the
   right repository using BSYNC_PATH. It will search from first to last path in the BSYNC_PATH
   variable, so if there are two repositories with the name, the first one will be used.
